This project is designed to manage a library system where users can perform basic operations such as adding books, removing books, and viewing the list of available books.

To achieve this functionality, we have implemented two main classes:

1. Book:
This class represents the concept of a book. Each instance of the Book class holds essential details about a book, such as its title.

2. LibraryMng:
This class handles the library management tasks. It maintains a collection of books, allows users to add new books to the library, delete books, and display the current list of books.
